    <h2>SQL Stored Procedures</h2>
    <p>A store Procedure is basically a set of SQL commands which you can package it and re use again and again.

    </p>
    <p>If you have a long SQL script which you need to run everytime, you can make it a procedure and call it in one line.</p>
    <p>EXAMPLE</p>
    <p>Lets say you have to build a report every week , where we need to pull Password information of persons with FirstName='bruce', we can write the script and create a SP and execute it in one line.</p>
  <p> See below Screenshot for how its done in SSMS.</p>

  <P><B>Advantages of Store Procs</B></P>
  <P>1.<b>Performance</b> : By grouping SQL statements, a stored procedure allows them to be executed with a single call. This minimizes the use of slow networks, reduces network traffic, and improves round-trip response time. </P>
<p>2.<b>Productivity</b> and Ease of Use : By designing applications around a common set of stored procedures, you can avoid redundant coding and increase your productivity.</p>
<p>3.<b>Scalability</b> : Stored procedures increase scalability by isolating application processing on the server.</p>
<p>4.<b>Maintainability</b> : Once it is validated, a stored procedure can be used with confidence in any number of applications </p> 
<p>5.<b>Interoperability</b>: The RDBMS allows a high degree of interoperability between Java and PL/SQL. Java applications can call PL/SQL stored procedures using an embedded JDBC driver. Conversely, PL/SQL applications can call Java stored procedures directly.</p>
<p>6.<b>Security</b> : You can restrict access to  data by allowing users to manipulate the data only through stored procedures that execute with their definer's privileges. For example, you can allow access to a procedure that updates a database table, but deny access to the table itself.</p>
