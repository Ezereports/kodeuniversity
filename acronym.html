    <h2>Acronym's used in SQL quering</h2>
  <P>Their are bunch of Acronym's which are in some way related during SQL quering, which are good to know as it makes life eaiser.</P>
<p><b>SQL </b><br> Structure Query Language</p>
<p> <b>SSMS</b> <br> SQL Server Managment Studio</p>
<p> <b>Alias</b> <br> A suedo name for a database object</p>
<p> <b>CTE</b><br>Common Table Expression</p>
<p><b>ACID</b> <br>
The acronym ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is related to the transactions. Most database management systems allow atomic, coherent, isolated and durable transactions.
</p><p><b>ASE</b><br>
Sybase ASE or Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise is the historic transactional engine of the Sybase editor, suitable for atomic transactions in a highly competitive environment.
</p><p><b>AWK</b><br>
awk is a row processing language for complex find, replace, and transform operations. The acronym is the names of the three authors of this language (Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, Brian Kernighan).
awk, nawk and gawk utilities - Tutorial - November 2nd, 2020
</p><p><b>BCP</b><br>
BCP (Business Continuity Plan) is the term for business continuity plan. The BCP plan consists of resuming IT systems activity as soon as possible after a disaster (fires, floods, etc.) . bcp (bulk copy) is also a utility in Sybase and Microsoft SQL Server clients to export/import data from a database.
</p><p><b>CIS</b><br>
CIS (Component Integration Services) are Sybase technologies allowing access to data external to a Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise server and querying them as if they were local (remote ASE servers, other engines like IQ, Oracle, DB2, MS SQL…, files).
</p><p><b>Cluster</b><br>
In network and systems, a cluster is a cluster of servers made up of at least two servers (also called nodes) and sharing a common disk bay, to ensure service continuity and/or to distribute the computational load and/or the network load.
</p><p><b>CRUD</b><br>
In computer programming, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete/Destroy) are the four basic functions of persistent storage.
</p><p><b>Datamart</b><br>
A Datamart or data store is a subset of a relational database containing aggregated informations or targeted data for a specific business. Datamarts are decision support or management tools and are part of business intelligence.
</p><p><b>DBCC</b><br>
DBCC (DataBase Consistency Checker) is a set of commands available in Sybase and SQL Server engines to diagnose or verify the integrity of databases (pages read, allocations checks, traces on processes, etc.).
</p><p><b>DBMS</b><br>
DBMS means Database Management System. The acronym RDBMS meaning Relational Database Management System is one variant.
</p><p><b>DDL</b><br>
DDL (Data Definition Language) is the acronym that designates all the SQL commands to structurally modify a database and its objects (creation of tables, indexes, views…, alterations…). For example, the CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE commands are commands in the DDL language.
</p><p><b>DML</b><br>
The acronym DML (Data Manipulation Language) is the set of all the SQL commands handling data in a database: reading, writing, sorting, etc. For example : INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY.
</p><p><b>DSS</b><br>
DSS (Decision Support Systems) refers to the tools or methods to collect, consolidate, model and restore a company's data in order to provide decision support. DSS applications are generally based on data warehouses, data coming from several heterogeneous sources.
</p><p><b>DTS</b><br>
DTS (Data Transformation Services) is the Microsoft proprietary technical layer for data flows design (extraction, transformation, loading).
</p><p><br>ETL</br>
ETL means Extract Transform Load. An ETL tool performs data flows from and to databases or files. Some of the most popular ETL tools :
</p><p><b>Extent</b><br>
An extent is a contiguous storage area reserved for a database object (tables, indexes, partitions, etc.). An extent reduces or eliminates fragmentation.
</p><p><b>FTP</b><br>
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for file transfers. ftp is also a Unix/Linux and Windows utility that uses this protocol.
</p><p><b>HA</b><br>
HA (High Availability) systems are high availability environments : if one component fails, another system takes over. High availability manages fault tolerance. Almost all database engines offer high availability solutions.
</p><p><b>LDAP</b><br>
Lightweight Directory Active Protocol (LDAP) is the protocol for querying and modifying a company’s directory services (groups, organizations, countries, accounts, etc.).
</p><p><b>OLAP</b><br>
OLAP means Online Analytical Processing. OLAP applications analyze instantly data along several axes to produce summary reports and provide decision-making support.
</p><p><b>OLTP</b><br>
The acronym OLTP means On-Line Transactional Processing and is related to online transaction processing in a database (INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE). So-called OLTP databases support well a large number of concurrent atomic transactions.
</p><p><b>PL/SQL</b><br>
PL/SQL (Procedural Language / Structured Query Language) is the proprietary procedural language in Oracle databases.
</p><p><b>RAC</b><br>
RAC (Real Application Clusters) is the Oracle product for high availability solutions with clustered Oracle instances.
</p><p><b>REST</b><br>
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Used mainly in HTTP requests, available operations are : GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS and TRACE
</p><p><b>RPC</b><br>
RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a network protocol for calling procedures on a remote computer. For databases, RPC runs a routine located on a remote database server.
</p><p><b>RTDS</b><br>
RTDS means Real Time Data Services and corresponds to the technologies developed by Sybase to set up real time gateways between the Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise databases or the Sybase Replication Server engine to message bus such as MQ Series or Tibco.
</p><p><b>SED</b><br>
Sed (Stream Editor) is a powerful Unix command for handling text. Sed reads input data line by line and the lines are modified with rules specified in its own language (sed program).
</p><p><b>SEO</b><br>
SEO (Search Optimization Engine) is a set of techniques designed to promote the understanding of the topic and the content of one or all pages of a website by search engines.
</p><p><b>SOAP</b><br>
SOAP means Simple Object Access Protocol. Built with XML, SOAP is a remote procedure call protocol for exchanging information within a distributed architecture.
</p><p><b>SSO</b><br>
SSO (Single Sign On) refers to single sign-on. This method allows a user to perform only one authentication to access corporate applications. The SSO method is generally based on querying the company’s LDAP directories and avoids the tedious multiplication of passwords to remember for the user. Most databases support SSO to perform authentication, unfortunately often through a licensed option.
</p><p><b>T-SQL</b><br>
T-SQL (Transact Structured Query Language) is a proprietary extension from Microsoft and Sybase to the SQL language. Compared to SQL language, T-SQL adds procedural programming (loops, triggers, stored procedures…), local variables and system functions for handling strings, dates, mathematical expressions…
</p><p><b>UDF</b><br>
UDF (User Defined Functions) in a database engine are functions defined by users in T-SQL, PL/SQL etc… The user functions are, like the system functions, evaluated in SQL commands. Scalar functions return a single value while tabular functions return a table with a result set.
</p><p><b>XML</b><br>
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is an extension of the HTML language. The term extensible for this language comes from the ability for the user to define custom tags and attributes through namespaces.
</p><p><b>YAML</b><br>
YAML - Ain’t Markup Language. It is not a markup language. Data is represented as scalars, lists and arrays with possible nestings. The YAML format is much simpler than XML, and even more human readable than the JSON format.
